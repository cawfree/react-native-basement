# 📦 react-native-basement
[React Native Basement]() defines a way to easily cache remote dependencies, whether they're images, JSON or raw file content. Using the [`useBasement`]() hook, extensible declarative resource caching is a breeze. 🌊

Caching is a support is a little patchy in React. There's [iOS-only support for the <Image /> component](), or dedicated libraries for specific types.

If you're only interested in caching images, I'd suggest taking a look at [react-native-cached-image](https://github.com/kfiroo/react-native-cached-image). If you're interested in caching **literally anything** else, this project is your friend!

## 🚀 installing

```bash
yarn add react-native-basement # or npm -i -s react-native-basement
```

That's about it! Please check out the [Getting Started](./docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) guide for integration details. There's also an included [Example App](./example/App.js).
